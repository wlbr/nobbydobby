# Task
Here's Nobbydobby, a kinda nerdy developer. Nobbydobby is 
preparing his birthday party, and he wants his friends to 
be able to sign up.

* To do this, he asks you to write a program in GO,
  Python or Java that offers an API for this registration.
* Nobbydobby's friends are all techies, so it's ok to use
  curl or bruno (postman).
* During the registration, the guests should enter 
  their name and email address, Nobbydobby needs a list of 
  participants at the end.

## Requirements
Your program should meet the following requirements:
1.  Users can register via a REST API.
2.  Users must provide their first and last name as well 
    as their email address.
3.  The program must output a list of participants for  
    Nobbydobby at the end.
4.  The program needs to handle reboots properly.
